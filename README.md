### Chrome CORS error on request to localhost dev server from remote site

Just a Chrome client way to ignore this warning and make assets accessable:

1. go to ```chrome://flags/#block-insecure-private-network-requests```
2. set ```Block insecure private network requests``` to Disabled

Note: this just works fine when you're in your own computer or your dev environment
